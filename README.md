# Building_Energy_Forecasting
One week ahead energy consumption hourly forecast. In this note book, i delved deep into short term load forecasting.
I compared various predictive ML models with Neural networks.

The following steps were taken as shown in the note book.

Data cleansing
Data Organisation
Data processing
Data analysis
Fearture engineering
Machine learning model design
deep learning model design
Model evaluation

Used scikit learn for regression mmodels and Tensor flow for Neural Netwoks

For this dataset, Conv1D (WaveNet) model was victorious
